# Borrow Health

This is a tool I built for myself to help prevent liquidations. Please don't actually use it for yourself or your account may magically combust. : ) 

## Getting Started

Using a Python 3.x.x environment, run the following to install all the libraries used in this repository:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Recommend using virtualenv to sandbox your work

## Infura/Alchemy API Keys

Some files include a line of code that connects to Infura or Alchemy nodes. I use the python-dotenv library to save environment variables.

You can read about python-dotenv [here.](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
